      "description": "This code snippet appears to be a method in Java that is responsible for parsing JSDoc information. The method starts by setting the initial state and skipping any end-of-line characters. It then proceeds to read tokens from the JSDoc token stream until the end of the comment is reached.\n\nThe method checks if JSDoc information should be parsed and records the block description if necessary. It then enters a loop to parse the JSDoc information with the help of a helper method.\n\nOverall, this method is responsible for parsing JSDoc information and recording relevant details for further processing.",

      "description": "This code snippet is a private method called `parseHelperLoop` that takes a `JsDocToken` and a list of `ExtendedTypeInfo` as parameters. It contains a while loop that iterates indefinitely, processing different cases based on the type of token received.\n\nThe method uses a switch statement to handle different token types. When encountering an ANNOTATION token, it checks the current state and then calls another method to parse the annotation. When encountering an EOC (end of comment) token, it performs some final checks and returns true. If the method encounters an EOF (end of file) token, it discards any accumulated information, builds the JSDoc, and returns false with a parser warning. If the token is an EOL (end of line), it resets the state if necessary. For any other token types, it adjusts the state and continues processing.\n\nOverall, this method is part of the JSDoc parsing process and handles different token types to extract and process JSDoc information.",

For each type of annotation, it performs different actions such as recording the annotation, checking for duplicates, recording information like author, deprecation reason, types, descriptions, and more. It also handles warnings and errors related to the annotations.\n\nThe method also handles special cases for annotations like `@param`, `@throws`, `@return`, `@type`, and others, where it records parameter types, throw types, return types, and type definitions.\n\nOverall, this method is a crucial part of the JSDoc parsing process, responsible for parsing various JSDoc annotations and recording relevant information for further processing.",
